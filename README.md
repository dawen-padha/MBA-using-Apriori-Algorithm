# MBA(Market Basket Analysis) using Apriori algorithm
First let's talk about what is market baket analyis and how we could implement that concept using one of the Association 
rule algorithm.

**Market Basket Analysis:** It is a data miining technique used by large retailers to discover association between items.It works by 
looking for combination of items that occur frequently in transactions. The analysis can help to promote deals , and make good offers.
Market Basket Analysis is modelled on Association rule mining and some of the alogrithms that we can use for MBA are **Apriori and Eclat**.
In Market Basket Analysis, we look to see if there are combinations of products that frequently co-occur in a transaction.

**Apriori Algorithm**: The components of Aprori algorithm are:
. Support
. Confidence
. Lift
Support: It has been calculated with the number of transactions divided by the total number of transactions made.
Condidence: It is calculated with combined transactions/individual transactions.
Lift: It is used to find out the ratio of increase in sales, calcultaed as confidence/support.
